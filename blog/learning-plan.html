            My strengths: My strengths are felxible,curiosity and open-minded.<br />

        <p>
            My Limitations: Language and communication could be my limitations. <br />I like challenging to new things
            and talking to new people, but English is not my first language. <br />
            Therefore, even if I know some coding or how to solve problems, it would be hard for me to explain
            everything what I would like to.

        <p>
            To stay focus the work what I have to do and I would like to develop the skill to ask for help when I get
            stuck. <br />I am not good at doing it because of my Japanese culture that you have to solve your problem
            without asking. <br />In addition to this, I would like to get more confident to speak and talk in English. <br>
            Also, I would like to improve my skill for giving good feedback and listening feedback that I receive.

        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2>
        <p>
            To work productively, I set up dual screen at my working space. I used to use a small laptop and it was hard
            for me to focus such a small screen because I need to search many things and I would like to do coding
            without switching screen. When things are building up and starting to get to me, I will talk to my
            facilitator for asking help or feedback.

        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <p>
            When I get stucked, I would spend 10 to 15 minutes to search but If I could not find any solution, I will
            ask for help to my facilitator.

            As I am still working as a freelance junior web designer for Japanese clients and I have some projects that
            have not finished yet. <br />I hope everthing is going to finish before Christmas and be ready for the boot
            camp next year! <br />
            I talked to my partner that I would like to focus on sutdying and need support from him to do houseworks.

      <p>I would be good listner and be good at doing as a driver when I code.</p>
      <p>
          Limitation would be my English because English is not my first language and still need to translate to my
          mother tongue to understand. <br />In addition to this, I am slow learner and I need a lot of time to
          unerstand the logic.
