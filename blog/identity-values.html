            Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. <br />Discuss how you weighed up the

          <p>
            During working hour at office, I found out that the account staff who sat next to me was sleeping. <br />I
            did not say anything to her or did not wake her up because I assume that she was exhausted or felt sick that
            day.<br />
            However, I started to encounter the situation several times. Eventually, I reported to my manager that she
            was sleeping during working hour. <br />I weight up the values which were honesty and integrity.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3-icon">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
          <p>
            I was born and grow up in Japan. <br />I assume that respect, harmony, order, and self-development are the
            most important values that underlie Japanese social interaction. <br />I have been influenced the value of
            respect. I always try to respect others, their opinions and culture. <br />Sometimes I would respect otherâ€™s
            decision without saying my idea or opinion because I would prefer to respect theirs.

            Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
          </h3>
          <p>
            My strengths are planning and felxible,adapting to new situation. <br />Even in my private time, I like
            organizing and planning such as travelling, moving in/out flat and shopping. <br />I would make planning
            sheet or shopping lists so that I can easily make action. <br />I have been to different countries and
            stayed there, because of this experience, I am totally fine with new and different situation. <br />In the
            workplace, I like adapting new tools and systems. <br />In the beginning, I would find it difficult to use
            them but I would enjoy exploring new stuffs.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h3-icon">
            Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with
            learning obstacles.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I assume that my flexible strength might help me while learning coding. <br />I would try new thing to find
            any solutions. <br />In other words, I would not stuch at same place, I would skip the part that I get
            stucked and do it later.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h3-icon">
            Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there
            was resistance or tension. <br />Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and
            your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.

          <p>
            It happned during we were haing first lockdown last year. <br />I was sharing the flat with 3 more people
            and we had to study or working at home. <br />I would like to focus on my work and need some quiet and
            bigger space to have two monitors. <br />I did not have desk at my bedroom therefore I had to use sharing
            living room to do my work....
          </p>
          <p>
            We discuss what time we would use the dining table to do anything and to become more productive, I bought a
            noise cancellation headphone not to be bother by other's voice or sound. <br />Next time, if I have a chance
            to move out, I would try to rent the flat which has a studying room. I would be lazy if I work at bedroom or
            living room because of distraction.
