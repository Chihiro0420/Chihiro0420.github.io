          <h2>
            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
          </h2>
          <p>
            1. Beleive yourself : <br />Everytime I got stuck (I got stuck every quesitons lol), I told my self that "
            This is not about how smart you are, it's just you have not understood YET! "
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Do not hesitate for asking help: <br />
            It was as if it were something humiliating. I have always thought that being independent meant the capacity
            to solve all the problems on my own. I realized that a lot of peer did not hesitate ask for help on
            foundation channel and facilltators or peers would hep you immediately and I felt that I was not the only
            one struggling of coding.
          </p>
          <p>
            3. Growth Mindset: <br />
            It would be similar to my above answer. So far, coding and understanding JavaScript is quite hard for me and
            I am worried about the bootcamp. However, if I do hard work, I will be able to understand and will be able
            to coding some day. I have not achived there yet but I just need more time to understand.

          <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
          <p>
            I beleive that it is important to have empathy with other members because we would work as a team. <br />In
            addition to this, self-awareness means knowing your values, personality, needs, habits, emotions, strengths,
            weaknesses, etc. With a sense of who you are and a vision of the person you want to become. <br />In
            learning and programming is not easy, therefore it would be better to know yourseld and if you know yourself
            better, you would be more productive and creative.
            <br />

          <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            I was surprised about "the power of yet". I watched the TED several times. It gives me motivation to keep
            coding and reminds me who I want to be and why I am studying now.

          <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
          <p>The most challenging part was sprint-4 and sprint 5.</p>
          <p>I struggled how to code, how to make it happen! Even I was coding in my dream lol</p>
        </section>
        <section class="l-wrapper-container">
          <h2>
            Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web
            development bootcamp course?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I believe that before becoming a programmer, it could be any job, but we need better "human skills" in our
            life. We will work with other people, you cannot live or work alone.

        <section class="l-wrapper-container">
          <h2>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
            that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h2>
          <p>
            It has been really useful to read on the topics in the core curriculum and then write up notes and publish
            blogs on research findings and share personal thoughts.<br />I found many intersting topics and it helped me
            a lot when I got stuck coding.
